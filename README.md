## Data
The study is based on anonymized clinical data from the MIMIC-IV database.
Due to data use agreements, the raw data cannot be shared.

## Methods
Several classification models were trained and evaluated, including:
- kNN
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
Model interpretability was assessed using permutation-based feature importance.

## Reproducibility
All analyses were conducted in R
